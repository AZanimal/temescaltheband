					Oakland based Temescal is made up of veteran Bay Area musicians who've performed throughout the Bay Area together and separately for the last two decades. Each musician brings a different element of musical roots to this unique ensemble and reflects our interpretations of deep cuts of Americana, Urban Rock, Rhythm and Blues, Funk, Soul, originals and straight up dance music.

					Lead singer Michelle Minsuk brings her rock, pop and soul influences for a driving vocal performance and blends perfectly with keyboardist Sharon Sofia, a beautiful natural harmonizer who also shares lead vocal duties. Mixing harmonica, occasional guitar, electric flute and percussion, her talents enhance the sound and really stand out.

					Guitarist Jerome Rainey rounds out the three part harmony parts and interacts perfectly with lead guitarist Tony Zepezauer. Their guitar conversations are crafted and well thought out parts that paint a bright musical tapestry.

					Chris Hanson is the musical director and holds it all down on the bass. He has extensive knowledge of music theory and classical training. Ken Horn is solid on the drum kit and can adapt parts to fit any song and style. He has taken the band to a new level as a driving rhythm force. Ron Marcus adds color and texture to the mix with his tasteful percussion talents. He is a lyricist with 900 songs in his catalog. He also has 30 spoken word CDs with Sharon Sofia exploring electric flute. The last 5 of them feature Grammy winner Mads Tolling (Bob Weir's Wolf Pack) on violin and the interplay with Sharon's electric flute and guitarists Jody Salino and Peter Harris from Grateful Tuna.
